# Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile üëã


I am a Mathematical Engineering - Statistical Learning student at Politecnico di Milano, currently doing an Erasmus semester at TUDelft. 

As you will see my projects are principally focused on the resolution of variuos problems through the implementation of Machine Learning models.

### üè´ **Education:**
- MSc in Statistical Learning track of Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano
- Erasmus semester at TUDelft
- Alta Scuola Politecnica (Politecnico di Milano Honor Program)
- BSc in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano

### üî® **Most interesting projects:**

---
* [`Mixed and functional analysis models for studying
Heart Failure (re)-hospitalizations`](https://github.com/gabrielecorbo/Applied-Statistics-project): The main aim of this study is to provide statistically relevant methods for identifying the potentially high-risk patients in advance and understanding which are the main patient-level features that have an impact on the re-hospitalization.
* [`Machine Learning model that uses Photovoltaic system power output to detect malfunctions`](https://github.com/gabrielecorbo/Machine-Learning-Project) : Exploited machine learning techniques to create a classification model to detect PV anomalies.
* [`Estimating Client's Needs using Machine Learning`](https://github.com/gabrielecorbo/Fintech-Project) : Exploited machine learning techniques to create a cross-platform web-app to recommend products based on clients' needs.
* [`Statistical analysis on biomechanical parameters`](https://github.com/gabrielecorbo/progetto-inferenza-statistica) : Linear regression and ANOVA on a dataset containing angles of various parts of the hip bone, in order to predict the lumbar lordosis angle and understand if a correlation holds between that parameter and the main pathology of a patient.
